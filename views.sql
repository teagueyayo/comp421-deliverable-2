-- VIEW 1 and 2 are both conditionally updatable because the database can uniquely identify the cid row,
-- which have fields that are updatable (int). However, the text strings are not updatable/setable.
-- Conditions that must hold so that a view can be updated in SQL:
---- columns can only be from one underlying table,
---- columns cannot have been derived from aggregation, function, computation (etc),
---- no use of GROUP BY, HAVING, or DISTINCT in columns
---- view canâ€™t use TOP with WITH CHECK OPTION
